 'Between "Charlotta" & "Glass City of Us" (2004-6), this darker album explored minimal ambient music. It used noise, line hum, record skips, and drone reverbs. Inspired by the idea that objects in math, physics, & chemistry have their own music, if we listen closely.',

The concept of "The City" emerged through the rough romantic plot of two people in a massive futuristic city, that seems dwarfed by the sentiments by them both.',

Everyone will have their own experience of the ambient medicinal sounds, finding itself roots in Minimalism, Drone, Noise, & Lo Fi. This was my original intent behind the contemplative sound, and music I created, whether I am successful, I leave that in your hands and your mind.',
