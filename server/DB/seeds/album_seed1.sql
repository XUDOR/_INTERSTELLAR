 'This album was a response creatively to the large project and emotionally requiring: VAGARY. WATERCOLOURS FOR FRIENDS was a return to a more simple melodic structure and production values of my first releases. With that in mind, I used sound sources and instruments from my first few years at sound design collage from 2002-3, with a view to create a minimalist palette.
A wonderful friend had remarked that though she appreciated the foreboding, emotional gravity and unsettling nature of VAGARY and other work, it was pieces like "Spherical" of NONAGON that she liked. As she could do other things and be in the space with the music.
These comments greatly influenced the composition and structure of the sound, treating them like large rooms of watercolour paintings that one could be inside.',

 $$One starts with no real intentions sometimes, and after awhile the idea formulates and direction emerges. Such was the case with "SAKURA". Written during April and May of this year, 2023, the materials gathered from improvised sessions were interludes between the walks along the seaside, where the blossoms fell from the trees.
All of this reminded me of the visit I had to Japan for 6 months in 1998-1999. I had been listening to a lot of city pop over the winter, and thinking about my good late friend Peter Stufano. I decided to use all of this as a starting point.
I had a small library of samples of my friends playing several instruments: tabla, dumbek, kalimba, and flute; and these became the sources in sampler instruments for the melodies. I used location recordings of the walks along the sea and record skips from the end of the city pop & Japanese jazz records I was listening to as a backdrop. The piano samples are from public outdoor instrument recorded a couple years ago, and the guitar work was completed this month.
These are the materials used to create the sonic paintings of my memories, please enjoy & thank you for listening.

 $$A cascade of experiences, a free fall into pulp science fiction of singular memory, set against 1990s electronic music’s landscape & language. What is the plot summary for our protagonist? Only the environments know. Written over 7 months pulling from reservoirs of old and new sounds: "Poem for a Homeworld" has a history of its own. Where are we in the index of portals? "Have I not been here before?" asks the lone traveller as all paths lead back to the beginning of the contemplations: "Am I alone? If I am alone in the universe, am I then not alone? If I am held in the embrace of the expanse of the universe?" These are the questions and revelations of our story, painted in the colours and reference of nostalgia.
A lament from a distant future, a chaos of remembrance; an understanding that all time exists at once, on the cusp of the Void. A narrative set against the abstracted lexicon of 90s ambient drum & bass on a bed of watercolours of experiments. Completed by the fall of 2023.$$,

 $$Written in 2023, "Rhombus" was a brief break away from "Poem For a Homeworld". It revealed itself a collection of sounds distilled into larger ideas. I had been learning about and working with AI, and the following assortment of music reflects this exploration, and the deeper meaning behind it all. It is written in lamenting tone, similar to "Poem...", but its more immediate in its time scale and locale. A strange new future awaits us I am sure, these are the meditations on those themes.$$,
